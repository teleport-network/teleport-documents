# A 1-Hop Ping-Pong Example

## How you can use this example:

1. When building your dapp, you can base the logic around the business logic provided to ensure that the dapp is communicating with XIBC contracts properly. 
2. Use this example to see whether the source and transformation chains are communicating properly. 

**Promise**: Developers of Teleport will ensure that this ping-pong example gets upgraded with developments in the chainso that you can always use it to check that the source and destination chains are connected. 

**How**: If an ACK packet can be heard within a particular time after the cross-chain packet is sent, it indicates that the cross-chain connection between the source and target chain is healthy. Otherwise, please contact the Teleport team.
